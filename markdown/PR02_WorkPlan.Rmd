**Work Plan/Assignments**

Since Cindy and Bradley worked on the Galton Data work for the first project, they will complete this project's Galton Data portion of work. Macy and Jordan will work on the Streaming Data portion of work.

**Completion Timeline**

Ideally, our group would like to have all our work completed before Thursday, April 7th, since that class period will not be dedicated to project work. However, if we do not have all work completed by that date, we are comfortable with having our work completed and submitted no later than the due. 

**Communication Plan**

Our group will continue communicating through our group text message, with the Group Project #2 forum on AsuLearn being our backup form of communication.
